# Maximizing Winter Range

Cold weather can reduce EV range by 20–40%, but smart habits keep you mobile.

## Before You Drive

- Preheat the cabin while plugged in to avoid drawing from the battery.
- Clear snow and ice from aero surfaces and wheel wells.
- Check tire pressure weekly; every 1°C drop can reduce PSI.

## On The Road

- Use automatic climate control with the heat pump if equipped.
- Enable eco or snow drive modes to smooth throttle response.
- Regenerative braking may be limited when the battery is cold—leave extra space.

## Charging Considerations

- Fast charging speed slows in freezing temperatures; plan longer stops.
- Arrive at fast chargers with a 10–20% state of charge for optimal speeds.
- Store cables indoors when possible to keep them pliable.

## Long-Term Care

- Wash regularly to remove road salt from brakes and suspension parts.
- Lubricate door seals to prevent freezing shut.
- Schedule a spring service check to inspect brakes and cabin filters.
