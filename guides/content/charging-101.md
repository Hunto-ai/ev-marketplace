Understanding how and where to charge keeps EV ownership stress-free.

## Charging Levels

- **Level 1:** Standard 120V outlet, ~5 km of range per hour. Useful for overnight top-ups.
- **Level 2:** 240V home or workplace charger, 30â€“45 km of range per hour for most EVs.
- **DC Fast Charging:** 50 kW+ public chargers delivering 150+ km in under 30 minutes.

## Connector Types

- CCS (Combined Charging System) is common for most North American EVs.
- NACS (North American Charging Standard) is rolling out across networks in 2025.
- CHAdeMO continues to serve select Nissan and Mitsubishi vehicles.

## Plan Your Network

- Map public fast chargers you trust along regular routes.
- Check network memberships required for activation and pricing.
- Monitor session fees versus time-based billing to avoid surprises.

## Home Charging Checklist

- Hire a licensed electrician to survey panel capacity and run a dedicated circuit.
- Choose a smart charger with load-balancing if panel capacity is tight.
- Enable scheduled charging to take advantage of off-peak electricity rates.

## Battery Health Tips

- Keep the battery between 20% and 80% for daily driving when possible.
- Precondition the cabin and battery while plugged in during extreme temperatures.
- Update onboard software to access the latest charging optimizations.
